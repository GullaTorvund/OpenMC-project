# OpenMC-project
Semester project in the subject "FYS4580 â€“ Introduction to Reactor Physics" at the University of Oslo.

In the project we get to know the open source Monte Carlo based reactor simulation program OpenMC (see www.openmc.org).
We start with creating a simple pin cell and finally build and test a European Sodium Fast Reactor (ESFR) core.
