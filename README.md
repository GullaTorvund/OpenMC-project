# OpenMC-project
Semester project in the subject "FYS4580 â€“ Introduction to Reactor Physics" at the University of Oslo.

In the project we get to know the open source Monte Carlo based reactor simulation program OpenMC (see www.openmc.org).
We start with creating a simple pin cell and finally build and test a European Sodium Fast Reactor (ESFR) core. 

The folder Simple_pincell models a water moderated uranium pin cell. In PWR_pincell, the simple pin cell is adjusted to mimic a PWR pin cell and is tuned to criticality. In the folder ESFR_fullcore, we have modeled a ESFR core, tuned it to criticality and done some analysis on the neutron flux and the depletion.
